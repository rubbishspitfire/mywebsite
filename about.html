          <p>I am a Atlanta-based Software Engineer. Trained in the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React & Node). 
            I have experience with creating front end designs using Bootstrap, Materialize, SCSS, JQuery, and HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. My background is in mainly in criminal justice. Currently, I am a graduate student at Kennesaw State University, 
            where I major in Cybersecurity. In my freetime, I like to play video games, watch anime, read various books and listen to music.
            My dream would be to collaborate to great software with great people.</p>

                    <h3>What motivational quotes that keep me going?</h3>
                    <p>Nothing in life is to be feared,<br>it is only to be understood.<br>Now is the time to understand more,<br>so that we may fear less.</p>
                    <p>Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that?<br>We must have perserverance and above all confidence in ourselves.<br>We must believe 
                      that we are gifted for something,<br>and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.</p>
                    <p>You cannot hope to build a<br> better world without improving the individuals.</p>
